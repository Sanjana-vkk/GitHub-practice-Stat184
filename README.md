    - (1 pts) You must commit your changes!
        - Write a descriptive commit message (e.g. "added Omar Hagrass to class table")
        - Use the default setting of Commit directly to the `main` branch
        - Click the green button "Commit changes" 
- Merge your updated copy of the repo with OmarHagrass's repo.
    - [Top right of YOUR GitHub-practice-Stat184 repo] >> Click "Pull requests" >> Click green button "New Pull Request"
    - GitHub will take you to MY (Omar's) copy of the repo (`OmarHagrass/GitHub-practice-Stat184` at the top)
    - Click the green button "Create pull request"
    - Describe the change again (e.g. "added Omar Hagrass to class table")
    - (1 pt) You must click the green button "Create pull request" so that I can see your edit!
- You're done!  
 
**Important**: Your entry may NOT appear on the class table right away.  Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "main" branch before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
